When I first started setting up my Django project, I honestly found it really challenging and a bit confusing. Coming from an Angular background, I was already used to a clean and predictable folder structure, so Django’s way of splitting projects and apps felt overwhelming at first. I kept wondering why tutorials showed another folder like “main,” while in my case I only saw the default “mydjangoproject” directory. Because of this, I ended up putting my views file in the wrong place, which was frustrating since it didn’t match the examples I was trying to follow.

The hardest part for me was figuring out how the project folder, the app folder, and the templates all connected together. Even just running the server felt complicated in the beginning. But after taking a step back, I carefully retraced the setup steps, created the “main” app properly, and moved my views and templates where they belonged. Once I followed Django’s structure, everything made more sense, and I was finally able to build the About page with template inheritance.
